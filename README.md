# Fake mint.com  (Sign-in form)

This is a project from "The Odin Project".

Instructions can be found here : https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms?ref=lnav

I had to rebuild the sign-in form made by the website mint.com :

 https://accounts.intuit.com/index.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Futm_medium%3Ddirect%26cta%3Dnav_login_dropdown

The idea was to practice HTML and CSS, especially for building forms.

The design and simplicity of the page made it a good example to follow.
